### Persona
Ahmed Abu Kamel, 26, Gaza.

I am a supermarket owner, I stay in the supermarket from 6am to 4 pm. Ten I go home to have my dinner. After that I go to hangout with my frinds until 9pm. After that I go home to watch a movie until 12 am the go to bed.

I hope to find away that helps me in my work in the supermarket and reduce workload specially in accounting and debt recording using papers. I hardly manage to keep my debt records, with mistakes and spending lots of time to write them down.
Sometimes I forget to write the debt because I have lots of customers in the same time.

I aspire to reduce work pressure and facilitate debt management and accounting work.

I like hanging out, watching movie, and organizing time, but I hate work pressure.


### Surveying:

 **Opening questions:** 
 
How do you do? How are you?

How is your work going?

 **Deeper questions:**

Do you provide debt service for your customers?

How do you manage your debt?

Did you try any application to solve your problems?
  
  If yes
   
   How do you find it? Does it solve all your problems? Or do you still have problems?
    
    If yes
      
      Are you still using the same application?

      Why did you stop using it?
   
   If no

If there is an application that solve your problems will you use it?

### User Tasks:
* Login and add new customer.
* add new debts to the customer you have jsut created.
* logout from your account.

 #### Synthesis
 From the users interviews, we came across a few interesting findings:
 our first hypothes which states that the supermarket owners need an app to help them organizing the debts was certainly true, but the second hypotheses which states the supermarket owners want to get rid of the reading and writing in notebooks or papers was not fully true, 50% of our sample accepted it, but the rest had a lack of trust in dealing with the apps only, and refused to leave the debt registration in the notebooks.
 
 ### Some Other observations:
  * For some of them it seems that they find it easy to use, 
  * And some of them had trouble with adding multiple debts from the add debt page.
  one of Them didn't get the idea about the testing and it's just a prototype !!however we clearaify and explain it at the start of the session but they still not getting it! .
  one of the users that were tested was trying to do other operations like search and deleting customer account and clear a customer balance,and kept complaining about that !
